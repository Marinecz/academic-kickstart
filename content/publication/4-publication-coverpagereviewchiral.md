abstract: "Proteins and peptides are primarily found in their L-form. Recent studies have shown that this homochirality is not guaranteed throughout life. Indeed, natural amino acid isomerization can be caused by an enzymatic or non-enzymatic process. The appearance of D-amino acids in proteins and peptides can influence human health and disease. Different chromatographic and electrophoretic techniques are developed for amino acid enantioseparation and the determination of chiral proteins and peptide sequences."
